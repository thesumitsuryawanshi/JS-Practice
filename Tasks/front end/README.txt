Please create a web page that sends an AJAX request to fetch a product list and render all the products in a table. See the design1.png file.

When the user clicks on a row, change the route (URL) and render the details of the item the user clicked on (as per design2.png).

You can send the AJAX request to https://uxgorilla.com/test/web/products.json for fetching the data.

The task should be done in Vue or Angular or Vanilla Javascript. Feel free to use any CSS library or do it from scratch.


The code will be evaluated on how close your output is to the design and coding standards (Hint: You can use a lint to make it easier for yourself).



You can push your code to Github.
Keep your code in a private repository and share the access with aman@uxgorilla.com and akshat@uxgorilla.com.

Weâ€™ll review and respond to every submission done by 11:59PM, 17th Feb 2021 IST.


For any queries, send an email to hello@uxgorilla.com

Happy Coding!
